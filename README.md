## Using & Modifying
I've uploaded these files under the MIT License, so feel free to use and/or modify anything here at your own risk.
It's generally a good idea to reference where code came from, but that's just my personal recommendation.

## What does this code do?
Check the READMEs in the various categorized folders. I used to include some documentation
in commit descriptions but I gave up on that and it was hard to find anyways. Feel free to
open an issue and I'll be happy tell you what I can.
